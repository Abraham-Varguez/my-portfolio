# Portfolio Website

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project serves as a showcase of my coding skills, featuring various projects I've worked on. The design concept draws inspiration from a YouTube video by the channel "How to become a developer," but I implemented it using React to highlight my proficiency in modern web development.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. The navigation incorporates state management to transform into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Dynamic Project Display:** Project data is stored in JSON format, and React's component structure is utilized to dynamically render and display multiple projects. This allows for easy addition and removal of projects in the future.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** I chose React to build this project to highlight my proficiency in this powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **CSS and HTML:** While the design inspiration came from a CSS and HTML-based tutorial, I adapted the styles and structure to fit into the React framework.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is used to enhance the interactivity of the website, providing a smooth user experience.
