              Greetings! I'm Abraham Varguez, a passionate Front-End Web Developer
              based in Charlotte, NC. With a background as an IV Technician at
              Atrium Health and Levine Cancer Center and a recent participant in
              the Road to Hire program, I've seamlessly transitioned into the
              world of tech. My expertise lies in crafting engaging and
              user-friendly applications using React.js. Beyond coding, I find
              joy in staying active with sports like Pickleball, conquering
              challenges in video games, and pushing my limits in runningâ€”I'm
              gearing up for my first 5k in just two weeks! Fluent in Spanish
              and surrounded by the companionship of a dog and two cats, I'm
              excited to bring my skills and positive energy to every project.{" "}
              <br />{" "}
